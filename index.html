        Wow! It's been a while since I did anything for the web that didn't include
        hours of messing with webpack or sorting out node dependencies.

        By the way, I'm glad you're reading the code.

            Hi there. I recently (May 2019) took down my site because it hadn't been updated in 5+ years. I'm still working on the replacement, so in the meantime here's the barebones version.

            My name is Tobias. I'm a design leader with an engineering background. I grew up in the Danish countryside but these days I'm based in San Francisco.

            I worked on the much hyped, now defunct <a href="http://wove.rip">Wove</a>, which was the world's first consumer product with a truly flexible multitouch display. I was there from 2014-2016 and got to work on pretty much every aspect of the product and brand.

            I'm somewhat obsessed witn 80's pen plotters. I wrote them a <a href="https://medium.com/@tobiastoft/an-intro-to-pen-plotters-29b6bd4327ba">love letter</a> in the form of a tutorial on Medium. For some reason it blew up on Hacker News last year.

            I run Pinterest ACT as my day job. We're a team of designers and engineers who work across brand and product on what the future of Pinterest might look like. Before joining Pinterest I was a Senior Director at the design firm <a href="http://www.ideo.com">IDEO</a>.
