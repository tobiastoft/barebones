        It's been a while since I did anything for the web that didn't include
        hours of messing with webpack or sorting out node dependencies. 
        I almost forgot how simple the web can be.

        I'm glad you're reading the code -- sorry there isn't much to see here!

            Hi there. At some point in 2019 I took down my site because it hadn't been updated in 5+ years. I'm still working on the replacement at a rate of about 1 byte/month, so in the meantime here's the barebones version.

            My name is Tobias. I'm a design leader with an engineering background. I grew up in the Danish countryside but these days I'm based in San Francisco.

            I worked on the much hyped, now defunct <a href="http://wove.rip">Wove</a>, which was the world's first consumer product with a truly flexible multitouch display. I was there from 2014-2016 and got to work on pretty much every aspect of the product and brand.

            I'm somewhat obsessed with 80's pen plotters. I wrote them a <a href="https://medium.com/@tobiastoft/an-intro-to-pen-plotters-29b6bd4327ba">love letter</a> in the form of a tutorial on Medium. For some reason it blew up on Hacker News last year.

            I'm currently a Creative Director at Google. Before that I spent time at <a href="https://medium.com/pinterest-studio/applied-creative-technology-at-pinterest-c079a384b66c">Pinterest</a> and at the design firm <a href="http://www.ideo.com">IDEO</a>.
